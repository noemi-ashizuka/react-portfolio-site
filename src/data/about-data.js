    description: ["Hello, my name is Salvina Noemi, or just Noemi. I am an Italian web developer.", 
      "In my 20s I left Italy to live first in London and then in Tokyo. I have been living in Tokyo for 3 years.", 
      "My background is in education. When I was in London I started working as a nanny and then I became a private tutor and an Italian teacher. In Tokyo I mostly worked as an English instructor.", 
      "In 2019 I started coding, at first as a way to learn something new and creative, but I soon realized that programming wasn’t just a hobby and I wanted to make it my career. That’s when I attended a coding bootcamp to speed up my learning and be with like minded individuals. The bootcamp was an amazing experience that taught me a lot about programming but also how to collaborate with a team to have your ideas come to life.", 
      "After the bootcamp I started freelancing and applying the things I learned. I am now looking for opportunities as a developer.", 
      "I would describe myself as curious and hard working. I enjoy programming and the constant learning that comes with it. I like to be challenged and I don’t give up until I complete my tasks."
